    <h1>Solbakken Cargo Bikes</h1>

    <p>
        At Solbakken, our resident democracy is comprised of the board, the resident council, and the collegium association. <br>The board, which is the dormitory's highest authority, consists of six members: two residents from the dormitory, two from the educational institutions, and two from the Citizens' Representation in the Copenhagen Municipality. <br>We also have a collegium association that organizes various social activities such as communal breakfast, clothes swapping, Fastelavn celebration, and summer parties.

        You can use this website to check the availability of the bikes here at Solbakken. Login and have fun!
